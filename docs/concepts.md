### Rhythm String

A Rhythm String represents a sequence of discrete musical durations. They are best understood with some examples:
- `'1234'` has four characters, and represents a sequence of four quarter notes
- `'w'` is one character, and represents a single `w`hole note
- `'hh'` has two characters, and represents a sequency of two `h`alf notes
- `'h h '` represents a sequence of four quarter notes (spaces may subdivide beats)
- `'h.h.'` is equivalent to `'h h '` (dots may subdivide beats)
- `'1..2..'` has 6 characters, and represents six eighth-note triplets
- `'1+2+3+4+'` is eight characters, and represents eight consecutive 8th notes
- `'1 2 3 4 '`is identical to `'1+2+3+4+'`
- `'1 + 2 + '` is eight characters and represents eight consecutive 16th notes
- `'1e+a2e+a'` is identical to `'1 + 2 + '`
- `'1....'` represents five quintuplets (any number of subdivision are possible)
- `'h34'` represents a half note and two quarter notes. `'h'` always represents a half note, and `'w'` always represents a whole note. Notice that this works a little differently than quarter notes: the duration of a `'1'` symbol may be shortened by the character that follows it (`'1+'` represents two eighth notes, not a quarter *and* an eighth note). While `'w'` and `'h'` my be divided into subdivisions like any other value (`'w...'`), the total duration incurred by `'w'` and `'h'` is never affected by subsequent characters.
